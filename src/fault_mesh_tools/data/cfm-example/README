This is a simple example demonstrating how to take triangulated
surfaces from the CFM and produce Cubit journal commands to create
a NURBS surface.  The starting point is To run the example we first:

1.  Create STL surfaces in in fault local coordinates. This creates a new
    directory with both STL files and Python pickle files with metadata
    describing the local coordinate system.

    ./test_fmt_fault_global_to_local_multi.sh

2.  Create the Cubit journal commands necessary to produce a Cubit net
    surface, which can then be saved as a NURBS surface.

    ./test_fmt_ts_fault_local_to_cubit_nurbs_multi.sh

3.  Once these have been completed, the journal file can be executed from
    within Cubit.
